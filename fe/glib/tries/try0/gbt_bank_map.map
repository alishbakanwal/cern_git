WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net controlA<13> is sourced by
   a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to
   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.
ERROR:PhysDesignRules:2423 - Invalid GTX dedicated clocking: The reach of a
   REFCLK coming from an IBUFDS element near another GTX and forwarded using
   dedicated routing is 6.  Block

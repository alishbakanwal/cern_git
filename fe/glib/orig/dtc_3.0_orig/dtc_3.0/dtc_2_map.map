Mapping design into LUTs...
ERROR:MapLib:979 - LUT3 symbol
   "icon/U0/U_ICON/U_TDO_MUX/U_CS_MUX/I4.U_MUX16/Mmux_O1_SW0" (output
   signal=icon/N2) has input signal "icon/CONTROL1<3>" which will be trimmed.
   See Section 5 of the Map Report File for details about why the input signal
   will become undriven.
WARNING:MapLib:701 - Signal clk_in connected to top level port clk_in has been
   removed.
ERROR:MapLib:978 - LUT3 symbol
   "icon/U0/U_ICON/U_TDO_MUX/U_CS_MUX/I4.U_MUX16/Mmux_O1_SW0" (output
   signal=icon/N2) has an equation that uses input pin I1, which no longer has a
   connected signal. Please ensure that all the pins used in the equation for
   this LUT have signals that are not trimmed (see Section 5 of the Map Report
   File for details on which signals were trimmed).
WARNING:MapLib:41 - All members of TNM group "clkDiv_clkout1" have been
   optimized out of the design.
WARNING:MapLib:41 - All members of TNM group "clkDiv_clkout0" have been
   optimized out of the design.
WARNING:MapLib:41 - All members of TNM group "clk" have been optimized out of
   the design.
WARNING:MapLib:50 - The period specification "TS_clk" has been discarded because
   the group "clk" has been optimized away.
WARNING:MapLib:50 - The period specification "TS_clkDiv_clkout1" has been
   discarded because the group "clkDiv_clkout1" has been optimized away.
WARNING:MapLib:50 - The period specification "TS_clkDiv_clkout0" has been
   discarded because the group "clkDiv_clkout0" has been optimized away.

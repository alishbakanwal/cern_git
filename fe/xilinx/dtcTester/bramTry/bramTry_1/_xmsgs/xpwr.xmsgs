<msg type="warning" file="Power" num="1489" delta="new" >The loaded design, &quot;<arg fmt="%s" index="1">sr_top.ncd</arg>&quot;, is not fully routed and/or placed and thus may lead to inaccurate or incorrect power and thermal analysis results.  It is highly suggested to use only fully placed and routed designs with XPower Analyzer in order to achieve an accurate analysis.

<msg type="warning" file="Power" num="1369" delta="new" >Clock frequency for one or more clocks was not found through
timing constraints (PCF file) or simulation data.  Without knowing the
clock frequency of all clocks, dynamic power information for those clock
domains will default to zero which may under-estimate the power for this
design.  To avoid this warning, provide at least one of the following:
  1. The proper timing constraints (PERIOD) for clocks (re-implement design
     and load the newly generated PCF file into XPower Analyzer)
  2. A post PAR simulation-generated VCD or SAIF file indicating clock
     frequencies
  3. The clock frequency for clocks in the &quot;By Type -&gt; Clocks&quot; view in the
     XPower Analyzer GUI and then applying &quot;Update Power Analysis&quot;

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.

Section 1 - Errors
------------------
ERROR:PhysDesignRules:2423 - Invalid GTX dedicated clocking: The reach of a
   REFCLK coming from an IBUFDS element near another GTX and forwarded using
   dedicated routing is 6.  Block
   mgt_param_package_src_gen.mgt/mgtLatOpt_gen.mgtLatOpt/gtxLatOpt_gen[1].gtxLat
   Opt/gtxe1_i (GTXE1_X0Y0) is more than that from its source clock. 
ERROR:Pack:1642 - Errors in physical DRC.

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net controlA<13> is sourced by
   a combinatorial pin. This is not good design practice. Use the CE pin to
   control the loading of data into the flip-flop.

Section 3 - Informational

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
  46 block(s) removed
 209 block(s) optimized away
  32 signal(s) removed

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

The trimmed logic report below shows the logic removed from your design due to
sourceless or loadless signals, and VCC or ground connections.  If the removal
of a signal or symbol results in the subsequent removal of an additional signal
or symbol, the message explaining that second removal will be indented.  This
indentation will be repeated as a chain of related logic is removed.

To quickly locate the original cause for the removal of a chain of logic, look
above the place where that logic is listed in the trimming report, then locate
the lines that are least indented (begin at the leftmost edge).

Number of errors   :   2
Number of warnings :   0

Section 1 - Errors
------------------
ERROR:Pack:1107 - Pack was unable to combine the symbols listed below into a
   single IOB component because the site type selected is not compatible. 

   Further explanation:
   The component type is determined by the types of logic and the properties and
   configuration of the logic it contains. In this case an IO component of type
   IOB was chosen because the IO contains symbols and/or properties consistent
   with input, output, or bi-directional usage and contains no other symbols or
   properties that require a more specific IO component type. Please double
   check that the types of logic elements and all of their relevant properties
   and configuration options are compatible with the physical site type of the
   constraint.

   Summary:
   Symbols involved:
   	PAD symbol "SGMIICLK_QO_N" (Pad Signal = SGMIICLK_QO_N)
   	SlaveBuffer symbol "clkdiv/clkin1_buf/SLAVEBUF.DIFFIN" (Output Signal =
   clkdiv/clkin1_buf/SLAVEBUF.DIFFIN)
   Component type involved: IOB
   Site Location involved: H5
   Site Type involved: IPAD
